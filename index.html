A spectre is haunting the UK —the spectre of debt</h2><p>Economic growth in the United Kingdom was unaffected for the most part of last year by the Brexit referendum thanks to the consumer-focused industries, according to the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/grossdomesticproductpreliminaryestimate/julytosept2016">Office for National Statistics (ONS)</a>.</p><p>But there is concern that this impulse to the British economy is unsustainable because it is based upon household debt, according to recent economic data.  The individual insolvencies of Britons spiked more than 19 percent in the third quarter of 2016, according to a <a href= "http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02885">report by the House of Commons</a>.</p><p>And although the Insolvency Service official statistics show that bankruptcies declined 1.5 percent in the same period, debt relief orders increased more than 15 percent, and individual voluntary arrangements spiked almost 29 percent compared to 2015. </p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568363/Regional_Insolvency_Statistics_2015_-_Constituency_Supplement_Release_-_web.pdf">According to the latest data</a>, the most affected region in England and Wales by insolvencies in 2015 was Torbay with a rate of 41 cases per 10,000 adults, followed by Kingston with 40.5; then Plymouth with 40; Stoke-on-Trent North with 36; Bootle with 36; Preston with 36; Scarborough and Whitby with 35 and Wallasey also with 35. The average for England and Wales stands at 18.</p>'

Not feeling you owe something yet?</h2><p>The Insolvency Service official statistics clarify that the rate of individual insolvencies decreased in England and Wales in 2015 by falling to 18 per 10,000 adults, an improvement from the 22 reported of 2014. This dropdown was preceded by decreasing trend that started after the financial crisis of 2008.  </p><p>However, according to <a href= "http://stats.bis.org/statx/srs/table/f3.1">data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</a> -the central bank of the central banks- the household debt as a percentage of GDP started to grow again in 2015 in the UK up to almost 88 percent, and the <a href= "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2017/speech954.pdf">Bank of England warned recently</a> that household debt remains as one of the risk factors to monitor in 2017, especially when the UK economy is bracing for a wild ride after the Brexit referendum. </p><p>“Much of the drive expansion of the UK economy has come from consumer spending. That is associated with the rise of consumer debt, and there are limits on how far that can go”, said Malcolm Sawyer, emeritus professor of economics at Leeds University in a telephone interview. </p><p>“It looks like one of the reactions to the Brexit vote was consumer spending going up rather than down and people in the last six months of last year were taking more debt than they had previously”, he added. </p><p>“Consumer debt cannot continue to rise and that will feed down to a slowdown in consumer spending that may well interact with a decline in investment. The two combined, I think might push the economy into recession”. </p>'

			html: '<h2>3. 2017, a perfect storm?</h2><p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also warned that consumption may decelerate “as higher inflation, largely caused by the sterling depreciation, weighs on household real incomes” in addition to the “uncertainty” caused by the Brexit referendum scenario where a decrease in business investment is expected.  </p><p>In the first three-quarters of 2016, the private capital investment decreased 2.2, 0.7 and 2.2 percent, respectively, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/datasets/unitedkingdomeconomicaccounts/current/ukea2016q3final.pdf">according to the ONS</a>. </p><p>The Gross Domestic Product, the main indicator of economic growth, increased 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2016, and over the last 3 years, the consumer spending has driven growth, with an expansion of almost 10 per cent since 2013. Agriculture, industry, and construction decreased in the third quarter of last year. </p><p>Malcolm Sawyer asserted that Brexit by its own will not trigger a full-blown recession, but he has alerted the risk of depending on household debt to fuel the sluggish growth after the financial crisis of the late 2000s, and the further implementation of budget austerity.  </p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned this week that the risks to the global economy such as political rejection to cross-border economic integration –Brexit and protectionism from the US president-elect Donald Trump– might decrease trade and migration, damaging productivity and incomes.</p><p>“In those advanced economies where balance sheets remain impaired, an extended shortfall in private demand and inadequate progress on reforms (including bank balance sheet repair) could lead to permanently lower growth and inflation, with negative implications for debt dynamics”, according to the World Economic Outlook update 2017. </p><p>Sawyer said that advanced economies, currently suffer what some economists call <a href="http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=secular-stagnation">“secular stagnation”</a> –negligible growth due to lack of investment and falling income–, a financial sector that is experimenting an unprecedented expansion, with some detrimental effects on the economy, as well as the impact of environmental factors.</p><p>This economic uncertainty, years of budget austerity and stagnated incomes also contributed to political shocks in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States, and gave momentum to populist political groups, typically xenophobic in some regions, fuelling feelings against trade and economic integration. </p><p>Elias Dinas, Professor in Comparative Politics Oxford University said in a telephone interview that it is not clear yet the interaction between economic factors and the rise of populist and hate political groups, but he asserted that lack of integration, investment, and planning by European governments is associated with those movements. </p><p>“During the crisis what happened is that the material and non-material sort of determinants of xenophobia in some form escalated. During the crisis you have a shock that resources are becoming more scarce and then not only you have to compete with national groups, but also with foreigners”, he said.</p>'

			html: '<h2>4. Financial forecasters not feeling haunted by recession</h2><p>Despite the dismal perspective of academics, government officials considered “remainers” and the OBR, financial forecasters are more optimistic about the United Kingdom economic performance in 2017. </p><p>“Nobody expects a recession anymore. We were one of the last ones to expect a recession, if not the last one, and now we made an upside review and only expect a slowdown, with a possible positive growth (in 2017), we have no zero or minus zero in our quarterly growth profile”, said in a telephone interview Andrzej Szczepaniak, research UK economist at Barclays Capital. </p><p>There is still the expectation that a weaker pound increases production anytime soon, compensating any deceleration in consumer spending. </p><p>Also, according to Oxford Economics, an Oxford University’s forecaster, consider as a rare event that advanced economies such as the UK can suffer a full blown recession by its own. </p><p>“Standalone recessions are extremely rare in the historical record. To get one in the UK you going to need a pretty big financial and confidence shock and neither of those we thought is likely to materialize, and is not materializing yet”, said in a telephone interview, Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Academics. </p>'
